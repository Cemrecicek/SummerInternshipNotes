## Using GPIO Pins

When working with GPIO pins, there are several key points to consider:
- **Power Supply:** GPIO pins are directly connected to the Pine A64â€™s processor. Incorrect connections or overloads can damage the hardware. Be careful when choosing your power supply.
- **Voltage Levels:** Pine A64 GPIO pins operate at 3.3V. Connecting 5V signals directly may damage the device.
- **Programming:** GPIO pins can be controlled using various programming languages like Python, C/C++, or others. As Pine A64 is Raspberry Pi compatible, libraries like RPi.GPIO can be used on Pine A64.

During my summer internship, I will be working with this SBC to connect a button and control an LED with it. As a first step, I researched the Pine A64 and learned how and where to connect the button.
